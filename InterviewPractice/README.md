Notes on algorithms interview:
- InterviewPractice
- CleanCode
- Testing 

To revise, start from easy to hard. 
Cycle one question at a time between: 
- Array
- Trees
- Queues
- Stacks
- LinkedList
- String
- Heaps
- Greedy
- DynamicProgramming
- Backtracking
- Graph
- BitManipulation
- Sorting

To try not to repeat old questions too much, 
look at the latest commit for a file to know which was the last question
and start from the next question after that commit.
